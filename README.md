# GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)

[![GSAP - Animate anything](https://gsap.com/GSAP-share-image.png)](http://gsap.com)

GSAP is a **framework-agnostic** JavaScript animation library that turns developers into animation superheroes. Build high-performance animations that work in **every** major browser. Animate CSS, SVG, canvas, React, Vue, WebGL, colors, strings, motion paths, generic objects...anything JavaScript can touch! GSAP's <a href="https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/ScrollTrigger/">ScrollTrigger</a> plugin delivers jaw-dropping scroll-based animations with minimal code. <a href="https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/gsap.matchMedia()">gsap.matchMedia()</a> makes building responsive, accessibility-friendly animations a breeze.

No other library delivers such advanced sequencing, reliability, and tight control while solving real-world problems on over 12 million sites. GSAP works around countless browser inconsistencies; your animations **_just work_**. At its core, GSAP is a high-speed property manipulator, updating values over time with extreme accuracy. It's up to 20x faster than jQuery!

GSAP is completely flexible; sprinkle it wherever you want. **Zero dependencies.**

There are many optional <a href="https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins">plugins</a> and <a href="https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Eases">easing</a> functions for achieving advanced effects easily like <a href="https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/ScrollTrigger/">scrolling</a>, <a href="https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/MorphSVGPlugin">morphing</a>, animating along a <a href="https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/MotionPathPlugin">motion path</a> or <a href="https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/Flip/">FLIP</a> animations. There's even a handy <a href="https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/Observer/">Observer</a> for normalizing event detection across browsers/devices.
